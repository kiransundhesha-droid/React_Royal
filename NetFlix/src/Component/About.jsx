        This Netflix clone replicates the core look and feel of the original
        platform, focusing on a clean, cinematic UI and smooth user experience.
        The interface uses a dark theme dominated by near-black tones to keep
        attention on the content, with bold red accents for branding and
        call-to-action elements. The navigation bar is fixed at the top and
        transitions smoothly on scroll, mimicking Netflix’s signature gradient
        effect. Movie and TV show content is displayed in horizontally
        scrollable rows, allowing users to quickly browse through categories
        such as Trending, Top Rated, and Originals. Each title card includes
        hover effects that reveal additional details like the title, rating, and
        brief description, enhancing interactivity without cluttering the
        layout. The design is responsive across devices, ensuring consistent
        behavior on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Overall, the clone
        emphasizes performance, visual accuracy, and usability while closely
        matching Netflix’s modern streaming interface. If you want:
